# Introduction
The Openbook Textbook Engine (OTE) is the system used for writing and publishing textbooks for the Openbook library of VCE textbooks.
An idea central to Openbook is the ability for everyone and anyone to access textbooks, as well as the ability for everyone
and anyone to contribute to textbooks. OTE is a CLI built with Python that takes care of exporting standard textbook files to rendered
HTML and PDF files.
